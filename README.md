  (Boilerplate Universal React PWA)
</h1>

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/emortlock/nextjs-boilerplate.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Opinionated starter kit for building a React PWA that can be run on a Node server using Express and Next.js or as a static site by making use of Next.js export function.

Aims to align as closely as possible to the [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) recommendations.

## Featured tools

### Next.js

### Express

### Tailwind

#### PurgeCSS

### Service Worker Precache

### Recompose

### Prettier

The starter kit comes with the [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) code formatter to provide a consistent style across the app. This tool parses written code and re-prints it following the configuration rules provided.

In order to get the best experience of Prettier it's highly recommended that you make use of an editor plugin to apply the formatting automatically (e.g. [Prettier - Code formatter](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-vscode) for VS Code). Alternatively you can make use of `lint:fix` npm script to target all files.
